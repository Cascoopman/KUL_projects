# KU Leuven - Master of Artificial Intelligence
### Projects

_Here you can find some of the projects done during my time studying the Master of AI at KU Leuven (23-24)_

There are two projects: one on quantization and indexing and another on distributed and parallel computing.
For each topic you can find the relevant code and report chapter.

### 1. Quantization and Indexing
**Scalable Nearest Neighbors:**
- ProductQuantization.java
- report_quantization.pdf (chapter 1)

**High-Performance Indexing Structures:**
- Bitmap.java
- Bitslice.java
- report_quantization.pdf (chapter 2)

### 2. Distributed and Parallel computing
**Vector Parallelization:**
- SIMD.cpp
- report_distributed.pdf (chapter 1)

**Temporal Big Data Analysis:**
- ShotDistribution.java
- FastestPlayers.java
- DistanceTravelled.java
- report_distributed.pdf (chapter 2)
